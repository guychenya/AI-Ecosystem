# UI/UX Design

## Design Principles
- Mobile-first, responsive layout.
- Clear, accessible navigation.
- Visual storytelling with mind maps and metrics.

## Main Screens & Components
- Hero Section: Landing, stats, call-to-action.
- AI Ecosystem Overview: Mind map visualization.
- Use Cases & Workflows: Step-by-step breakdowns.
- Real-World Projects: Cards with metrics and details.
- Infrastructure & Deployment: Platform and DevOps visuals.

## User Flows
- Visitor lands on home → explores sections via navigation → drills into use cases/projects → views details in modals or expanded views.

## Wireframes/Mockups
_Include wireframes or link to Figma/Sketch prototypes here if available._
