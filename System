# System Architecture

## High-Level Overview
A single-page React application, driven by structured JSON data and interactive visualizations, deployed as a static site.

## Components / Services
- React frontend, responsible for all UI rendering and navigation.
- Static JSON data stores for use cases and projects.
- Visualization libraries for charts and mind maps.
- Jekyll/GitHub Pages for deployment (via GitHub Actions).

## Data Flow
- User loads site → React components fetch and render JSON data (use cases, projects) → UI updates with interactive elements.
- Navigation and modals managed client-side.

## Architecture Diagrams
_Add diagrams here if available (e.g., mind map, component diagram, data flow chart)._
